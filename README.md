## Introduction

Golang currently has no officially supported process management tools. For the deployment of Golang services, some use Linux built-in commands such as `nohup [process] &`, or the process management tools provided by the operating system such as SystemD. Alternatively, third-party process management tools such as: Python's Supervisor or Node.js PM2 can also be utilized

Each method has certain advantages and disadvantages. We hope to provide a convenient and easy-to-use tool for Golang process deployment. There is no need to install other dependencies besides `bash-completion` for ease of command line utilization.

Unlike PM2, `pmon3` is managed directly by the OS process manager, so even if the `pmon3` management tool abnormally terminates, it will not affect the parent `pmond` process itself. This is currently achieved by separating the `pmond` daemon process from the `pmon3` agent.

By default, if a process abnormally terminates, `pmond` will try to restart the process. If you don't want a process to restart automatically, then you can provide the `--no-autorestart` parameter flag.

## How To Install

[Releases](https://github.com/joe-at-startupmedia/pmon3/releases) 

### Using Makefile
The systemd installation process entails the following steps:
1. create the log, configuration and database directories
1. create the log rotation file
1. create the bash completion profile (requires the bash-completion package)
1. enable and start the `pmond` system service

```shell
#build the project
make build
#install on systemd-based system
make systemd_install
```

<a name="release_installer"></a>
### Using Release Installer

```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joe-at-startupmedia/pmon3/master/release-installer.bash | bash -s 1.14.7
```

:exclamation::exclamation: Note :exclamation::exclamation:

After installing `pmon3` for the first time, both installation methods provided above should automatically enable and start the service. if the `pmond` service does not start automatically, you need to manually start the service.

```shell
sudo systemctl start pmond

# Others
sudo /usr/local/pmon3/bin/pmond &
```

```

<a name="pmon3_exec"></a>
#### Running process [run/exec]

```
pmon3 exec [application_binary] [flags]
```

<a name="exec_flags"></a>
The starting process accepts several parameters. The parameter descriptions are as follows:

```
// The process name. It will use the file name of the binary as the default name if not provided 
--name

// Where to store logs. It will use the following as the default: /var/log/pmon3/
--log   -l

// Only custom log directory, priority is lower than --log
--log_dir -d

// Provide parameters to be passed to the binary, multiple parameters are separated by spaces
--args  -a "-arg1=val1 -arg2=val2"

// managing user
--user  -u

// Do not restart automatically. It will automatically restart by default.
--no-autorestart    -n
```

#### Exampleï¼š

```
pmon3 exec ./bin/gin --args "-prjHome=`pwd`" --user ntt360
```

:exclamation::exclamation: Note :exclamation::exclamation:

Parameter arguments need to use the absolute path.

#### View List  [ list/ls ]

```
pmon3 ls
```

#### Top Native [ topn ]

This will output the resource utilization of all processes using the native `top` command that is pre-installed on most unix-based operating systems. It will only show those processes managed by (and including) the `pmond` process. The output is updated every few seconds until the process is terminated using Ctrl+C.

```
pmon3 topn
```

<a name="section_config"></a>
## Application Config

By default, when `pmond` is restarted from a previously stopped state, it will load all processes in the database that were previously running, have been marked as stopped as a result of pmond closing and have `--no-autorestart` set to false (default value).

#### Criteria
 When an application config is provided `pmond` will instead refer to the `apps` array specified based on the following criteria:
1. When `pmond` is starting from a fresh install
2. When `pmon3` successfully executes a [drop](#pmon3_drop) command followed by running an [init](#pmon3_init) command.

If [init](#pmon3_init) is ran while there are still stopped process in the database (resulting from `pmond` daemon restart or [kill](#pmon3_kill), the Application config will *NOT* be used, and instead the previously-stopped process will be restarted.

#### Configuration

#### /etc/pmon3/config/config.yml
```yaml
apps_config_file: /etc/pmon3/config/apps.config.json
```

#### /etc/pmon3/config/app.config.json
```json
{
  "apps": [
    {
      "file": "/usr/local/bin/happac",
      "flags": {
        "name": "happac1",
        "args": "-h startup-patroni-1.node.consul -p 5555 -r 5000",
        "user": "vagrant"
      }
    },
    {
      "file": "/usr/local/bin/happab",
      "flags": {
        "name": "happac2",
        "log": "happac2",
        "args": "-h startup-patroni-1.node.consul -p 5556 -r 5001",
        "user": "vagrant"
        "no_auto_restart": true
      }
    },
    {
      "file": "/usr/local/bin/node",
      "flags": {
        "name": "metabase-api",
        "args": "/var/www/vhosts/metabase-api/index.js",
        "user": "dw_user"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

All possible `flags` values matching those specified in the [exec](#exec_flags) command:

* user
* log
* log_dir
* no_auto_restart
* args
* name

## Event Handling With Custom Scripts

```yaml
# a script to execute when a process is restarted which accepts the process details json as the first argument
on_process_restart_exec: ""
# a script to execute when a process fails (--no-autorestart) which accepts the process details json as the first argument
on_process_failure_exec: ""
```

#### 1. Specify the executable script to run for the `on_process_restart_exec` value. `pmond` will pass a json-escaped string of the process details as the first argument.
#### /etc/pmond/config/config.yml
```yaml
on_process_restart_exec: "/etc/pmon3/bin/on_restart.bash"
```

#### 2. create the script to accept the json-escaped process details:
#### /etc/pmon3/bin/on_restart.bash
```bash
PROCESS_JSON="$1"
PROCESS_ID=$(echo "${PROCESS_JSON}" | jq '.id')
PROCESS_NAME=$(echo "${PROCESS_JSON}" | jq '.name')
echo "process restarted: ${PROCESS_ID} - ${PROCESS_NAME}" >> /var/log/pmond/output.log
```

#### 3. start pmond in debug mode
```bash 
$ PMON3_DEBUG=true pmond
INFO/vagrant/go_src/pmon3/pmond/observer/observer.go:29 pmon3/pmond/observer.HandleEvent() Received event: &{restarted 0xc0001da630}
WARN/vagrant/go_src/pmon3/pmond/observer/observer.go:47 pmon3/pmond/observer.onRestartEvent() restarting process: happac3 (3)
DEBU/vagrant/go_src/pmon3/pmond/observer/observer.go:70 pmon3/pmond/observer.onEventExec() Attempting event executor(restarted): /etc/pmon3/bin/on_restart.bash "{\"id\":3,\"created_at\":\"2024-05-03T05:44:25.114957302Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2024-05-03T06:09:18.71222185Z\",\"pid\":4952,\"log\":\"/var/log/pmond/acf3f83.log\",\"name\":\"happac3\",\"process_file\":\"/usr/local/bin/happac\",\"args\":\"-h startup-patroni-1.node.consul -p 5557 -r 5002\",\"status\":2,\"auto_restart\":true,\"uid\":1000,\"username\":\"vagrant\",\"gid\":1000}"
```

#### 4. confirm the script executed successfully
```bash
$ tail /var/log/pmond/output.log
process restarted: 4 - "happac4"
```

## Debugging

### Environment Variables

You can specify debug verbosity from both the `pmon3` client and the `pmond` daemon process using the `PMON3_DEBUG` environment variable.

```bash
PMON3_DEBUG=true pmond 
```

`PMON3_DEBUG` accepts the following values:
* `true`: sets the debug level to debug
* `debug`: has the same effect as true
* `info`: sets the debug level to info
* `warn`: sets the debug level to warn
* `error`: sets the debug level to error

You can also debug the underlying IPC library using `QOG_DEBUG=true`

```bash
QOG_DEBUG=true IPC_DEBUG=true PMON3_DEBUG=true pmon3 ls
```

### Configuration File

If you want more control over the verbosity you can set the loglevel in the yaml configuration file.

##### /etc/pmond/config/config.yml
```
# log levels: debug/info/warn/error
log_level: "info"
```

If you do not specify a value, `info` will be the default Logrus level.

## Performance Prioritization

### CGO_ENABLED=0

By default, no underlying libraries require CGO. This allows for portability between machines using different versions of GLIBC and also provides easy installation using the [Release Installer](#release_installer) . Benchmarking results have confirmed less memory and CPU utilization compared to using the libraries which do require `CGO_ENABLED=1` provided below:

### Posix MQ

The `posix_mq` build tag can be provided to swap out the underlying [golang-ipc](https://github.com/joe-at-startupmedia/golang-ipc/) library with [posix_mq](https://github.com/joe-at-startupmedia/posix_mq). The `posix_mq` wrapper does require `CGO_ENABLED=1` and is considerably faster but also consumes slightly more CPU and Memory. To enable `posix_mq` during the build process:
```bash
BUILD_TAGS="posix_mq" make build_cgo
```

### CGO-based Sqlite

By default, `pmon3` utilizes an non-CGO version of sqlite which is unnoticably less performant in most circumstances. To enable the CGO version of sqlite:
```bash
BUILD_TAGS="cgo_sqlite" make build_cgo
```

It depends on your requirements whether you need one or both. To enable both of these CGO-dependent modules for maximizing overall performance:
```bash
BUILD_TAGS="posix_mq,cgo_sqlite" make build_cgo
```

Or without using the Makefile:
```bash
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -tags "posix_mq,cgo_sqlite" -o bin/pmon3 cmd/pmon3/pmon3.go
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -tags "posix_mq,cgo_sqlite" -o bin/pmond cmd/pmond/pmond.go
```

<a name="section_problems"></a>
## Common Problems

### 1. Log Rotation?

`pmon3` comes with a logrotate configuration file, which by default utilizes the `/var/log/pmond` directory. If you require a custom log path, you can customize `config.yml` and `rpm/pmond.logrotate`

### 2. The process startup parameter must pass the absolute path?

If there is a path in the parameters you pass, please use the absolute path. The `pmon3` startup process will start a new sandbox environment to avoid environmental variable pollution.

### 3. Command line automation

`pmon3` provides Bash automation. If you find that the command cannot be automatically provided, please install `bash-completion` and exit the terminal to re-enter:

```shell
sudo yum install -y bash-completion
```

#### Using ZSH instead of Bash
```shell
autoload -U +X compinit && compinit
autoload -U +X bashcompinit && bashcompinit
sudo sh -c "pmon3 completion zsh > /etc/profile.d/pmon3.sh"
source /etc/profile.d/pmon3.sh
```

### 4. FATA/vagrant/go_src/pmon3/cmd/pmon3/pmon3.go:27 main.main() pmond must be running

If you encounter the error above, make sure the `pmond` service has started successfully.

```shell
sudo systemctl start pmond
```

### 5. Should I use `sudo` commands?

You should only use `sudo` to start the `pmond` process which requires superuser privileges due to the required process forking commands. However, the `pmon3` cli should be used *without* `sudo` to ensure that the spawned processes are attached to the correct parent pid. When using `sudo`, the processes will be attached to ppid 1 and as a result, will become orphaned if the `pmond` process exits prematurely. Using `sudo` also prevents non-root users from being able to access the log files. The following Makefile command applies the adequate non-root permissions to the log files.

#### Applying permissions
```shell
#This is automatically called by make systemd_install
make systemd_permissions
```

#### Spawn a new process as the root user without using `sudo`
```
pmon3 exec /usr/local/bin/happac --user root
```
