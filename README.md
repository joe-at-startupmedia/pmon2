`pmon3` is a process manager which allows you to keep applications alive forever. Processes can be declared directly via the command line or in a configuration file. `pmon3` allows you to get started quickly while also providing configuration granularity at both the system and process level.

## Introduction

Golang currently has no officially supported process management tools. For the deployment of Golang services, some use Linux built-in commands such as `nohup [process] &`, or the process management tools provided by the operating system such as SystemD. Alternatively, third-party process management tools such as: Python's Supervisor or Node.js PM2 can also be utilized

Each method has certain advantages and disadvantages. We hope to provide a convenient and easy-to-use tool for Golang process deployment. There is no need to install other dependencies besides `bash-completion` for ease of command line utilization.

Unlike PM2, `pmon3` is managed directly by the OS process manager, so even if the `pmon3` CLI management tool abnormally terminates, it will not affect the parent `pmond` process itself. This is currently achieved by separating the `pmond` daemon process from the `pmon3` CLI agent.

By default, if a process abnormally terminates, `pmond` will try to restart the process. If you don't want a process to restart automatically, then you can provide the `--no-autorestart` parameter flag.

## How To Install

[Releases](https://github.com/joe-at-startupmedia/pmon3/releases) 

### Using Makefile
The systemd installation process entails the following steps:
1. create the log, configuration and database directories
1. create the log rotation file
1. create the bash completion profile (requires the bash-completion package)
1. enable and start the `pmond` system service

```bash
#build the project
make build
#install on systemd-based system
make systemd_install
```

<a name="release_installer"></a>
### Using Release Installer

```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joe-at-startupmedia/pmon3/master/release-installer.bash | bash -s 1.16.0
```

:exclamation::exclamation: Note :exclamation::exclamation:

After installing `pmon3` for the first time, both installation methods provided above should automatically enable and start the service. if the `pmond` service does not start automatically, you need to manually start the service.

```bash
sudo systemctl start pmond

# Others
sudo /usr/local/pmon3/bin/pmond &
```

### Running process [run/exec]

```bash
pmon3 exec [application_binary] [flags]
```

<a name="exec_flags"></a>
The starting process accepts several parameters. The parameter descriptions are as follows:

```
// The process name. It will use the file name of the binary as the default name if not provided 
--name

// Where to store logs. It will override the confuration files `logs_dir` property
--log-dir

// The absolute path of a custom log file
--log  -l

// Provide parameters to be passed to the binary, multiple parameters are separated by spaces
--args  -a "-arg1=val1 -arg2=val2"

// Provide environment variables (appended to those already existing on the system `os.Environ()`)
--env-vars "ENV_VAR_1=env_var_1_value ENV_VAR_2=env_var_2_value"

// managing user
--user -u

// Do not restart automatically. It will automatically restart by default.
--no-autorestart  -n

// Provide a list of process names that this process will depend on
--dependencies parent-process-name [--dependencies parent-process-name2]...

//provide a list of group names this process is associated to
--groups group-name-one [--groups group-name-2]
```

#### Exampleï¼š

```bash
pmon3 exec ./bin/gin --args "-prjHome=`pwd`" --user ntt360
```

:exclamation::exclamation: Note :exclamation::exclamation:

Parameter arguments need to use the absolute path.

### View List  [ list/ls ]

```bash
pmon3 ls
```

### Top Native [ topn ]

This will output the resource utilization of all processes using the native `top` command that is pre-installed on most unix-based operating systems. It will only show those processes managed by (and including) the `pmond` process. The output is updated every few seconds until the process is terminated using Ctrl+C.

```bash
pmon3 topn
```

```bash
pmon3 restart [id or name]
```

<a name="pmon3_stop"></a>
### Stop the process  [ stop ]

```bash
pmon3 stop [id or name]
```

### Process logging

```bash
# view logs of the process specified
pmon3 log [id or name]

# view logs of the process specified including those previously rotated/archived
pmon3 log -a [id or name]

# Similar to using `tail -f xxx.log`
pmon3 logf [id or name]
```

### Delete the process  [ del/delete ]

```bash

pmon3 dgraph --apps-config-only

#processes specified in the Apps Config and the database
pmon3 dgraph
```

<a name="section_config"></a>
## Configuration
The default path of the configuration file is `/etc/pmon3/config/config.yml`. This value can be overridden with the `PMON3_CONF` environment variable. 
The following configuration options are available:
```yaml
# directory where the database is stored
data_dir: /etc/pmon3/data
# directory where the logs are stored
logs_dir: /var/log/pmond
# log levels: debug/info/warn/error
log_level: info
# kill processes on termination
handle_interrupts: true
# poll processes every [n] milliseconds
process_monitor_interval: 500
# wait [n] seconds before monitoring process statuses
initialization_period: 30
# enable flap detection
flap_detection_enabled: false
# the amount of times a process can restart (within the countdown threshold) until backoff evaluation begins
flap_detection_threshold_restarted: 5
# the amount of process monitor intervals during a processes backoff period until process evaluation proceeds as normal
flap_detection_threshold_countdown: 120
# the amount of process monitor intervals during a processes backoff period until the processes restart counter is decremented. disabled with 0 value.
flap_detection_threshold_decrement: 60
# wait [n] milliseconds before outputting list after running init/stop/restart/kill/drop/exec
cmd_exec_response_wait: 1500
# wait [n] milliseconds after connecting to IPC client before issuing commands
ipc_connection_wait: 0
# wait [n] milliseconds after enqueueing a dependent process
dependent_process_enqueued_wait: 2000
# a script to execute when a process is restarted which accepts the process details json as the first argument
on_process_restart_exec:
# a script to execute when a process fails (--no-autorestart) which accepts the process details json as the first argument
on_process_failure_exec:
# specify a custom posix_mq directory in order to apply the appropriate permissions
#posix_mq_dir: /dev/mqueue/
# specify a custom shared memory directory in order to apply the appropriate permissions
shmem_dir: /dev/shm/
# specify a custom user to access files in posix_mq_dir  or shmem_dir
#mq_user:
# specify a custom group to access files in posix_mq_dir or shmem_dir (must also provide a user)
#mq_group:
# a JSON configuration file to specify a list of apps to start on the first initialization
apps_config_file: /etc/pmon3/config/app.config.json
```

All configuration changes are effective when the next command is issued - restarting pmond is unnecessary.

### Environment Variables

The configuration values can be overridden using environment variables:

* `CONFIGOR_DATADIR`
* `CONFIGOR_LOGSDIR`
* `CONFIGOR_LOGLEVEL`

<a name="section_appconfig"></a>
## Application Config

By default, when `pmond` is restarted from a previously stopped state, it will load all processes in the database that were previously running, have been marked as stopped as a result of pmond closing and have `--no-autorestart` set to false (default value).
If applications are specified in the Apps Config, they will overwrite matching processes which already exist in the database.

### Configuration

#### /etc/pmon3/config/config.yml
```yaml
#default value when empty or omitted
apps_config_file: /etc/pmon3/config/apps.config.json
```

#### /etc/pmon3/config/app.config.json
```json
{
  "apps": [
    {
      "file": "/usr/local/bin/happac",
      "flags": {
        "name": "happac1",
        "args": "-h startup-patroni-1.node.consul -p 5555 -r 5000",
        "user": "vagrant",
        "log_dir": "/var/log/custom/",
        "dependencies": ["happac2"],
        "groups": ["happac"]
      }
    },
    {
      "file": "/usr/local/bin/happab",
      "flags": {
        "name": "happac2",
        "log": "/var/log/happac2.log",
        "args": "-h startup-patroni-1.node.consul -p 5556 -r 5001",
        "user": "vagrant",
        "no_auto_restart": true,
        "groups": ["happac"]
      }
    },
    {
      "file": "/usr/local/bin/node",
      "flags": {
        "name": "metabase-api",
        "args": "/var/www/vhosts/metabase-api/index.js",
        "env_vars": "NODE_ENV=prod",
        "user": "dw_user"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Dependencies

Depenencies can be provided as a json array and determine the order in which the processes are booted. They are sorted using a directed acyclic graph meaning that there cannot be cyclical dependencies between processes (for obvious reasons). Dependecy resolution can be debugged using the [dgraph](#pmon3_dgraph) command. Parent processes can wait [n] amount of seconds between spawning dependent processes by utilziing the `dependent_process_enqueued_wait` configuration variable which currently defaults to 2 seconds.


### Flags

All possible `flags` values matching those specified in the [exec](#exec_flags) command:

* user
* log
* log_dir
* no_auto_restart
* args
* env_vars
* name
* dependencies
* groups

<a name="section_groups"></a>
## Groups

Groups are useful when dealing with a large ammount of related processes. Like processes, they are stored in the database and provide many-to-many cardinality. This allows the ability to addociate multiple groups to one or more processes and vice versa. Groups can be managed via configuration and through the command line interface.

### Commands
```
group level commands

Usage:
  pmon3 group [command]

Aliases:
  group, groups

Available Commands:
  assign      assign a group(s) to process(es)
  create      create a new group
  del         del a group
  desc        Show group details and associated processes
  drop        delete all processes associated to a group
  ls          list all groups
  remove      remove process(es) from group(s)
  restart     (re)start processes by group id or name
  stop        stop all processes associated to a group

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for group

Use "pmon3 group [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### Examples

First lets create a group
```
pmon3 group create happac
```

Next, lets assign it to processes with ids 3 and 4
```
pmon3 group assign happac 3,4
```

Now, lets confirm that it was associated to the correct processes:
```
pmon3 group desc happac
```
![Screenshot Groups Desc](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/446dbb6d-0ae5-47d2-bf99-6b5d9c314428)

Oops, process 4 should not be associated with the happac group, lets remove the association:
```
pmon3 group remove happac 4
```

This groups is no longer useful, lets delete it while keeping the processes intact:
```
pmon3 group del happac
```

### Reloading Application Config Changes

If you make a change to the group in the [Application Config](#section_appconfig) while pmond is running, you can make the changes take effect by running the `init` command. The `init` command should not restart processes which are already running but it will apply changes from the application config file.
```
pmon3 init
```

<a name="section_events"></a>
## Event Handling With Custom Scripts

```yaml
# a script to execute when a process is restarted which accepts the process details json as the first argument
on_process_restart_exec: ""
# a script to execute when a process fails (--no-autorestart) which accepts the process details json as the first argument
on_process_failure_exec: ""
```

### 1. Specify the executable script to run for the `on_process_restart_exec` value. `pmond` will pass a json-escaped string of the process details as the first argument.
#### /etc/pmond/config/config.yml
```yaml
on_process_restart_exec: "/etc/pmon3/bin/on_restart.bash"
```

### 2. create the script to accept the json-escaped process details:
#### /etc/pmon3/bin/on_restart.bash
```bash
PROCESS_JSON="$1"
PROCESS_ID=$(echo "${PROCESS_JSON}" | jq '.id')
PROCESS_NAME=$(echo "${PROCESS_JSON}" | jq '.name')
echo "process restarted: ${PROCESS_ID} - ${PROCESS_NAME}" >> /var/log/pmond/output.log
```

### 3. start pmond in debug mode
```bash 
$ PMON3_DEBUG=true pmond
INFO/vagrant/go_src/pmon3/pmond/observer/observer.go:29 pmon3/pmond/observer.HandleEvent() Received event: &{restarted 0xc0001da630}
WARN/vagrant/go_src/pmon3/pmond/observer/observer.go:47 pmon3/pmond/observer.onRestartEvent() restarting process: happac3 (3)
DEBU/vagrant/go_src/pmon3/pmond/observer/observer.go:70 pmon3/pmond/observer.onEventExec() Attempting event executor(restarted): /etc/pmon3/bin/on_restart.bash "{\"id\":3,\"created_at\":\"2024-05-03T05:44:25.114957302Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2024-05-03T06:09:18.71222185Z\",\"pid\":4952,\"log\":\"/var/log/pmond/acf3f83.log\",\"name\":\"happac3\",\"process_file\":\"/usr/local/bin/happac\",\"args\":\"-h startup-patroni-1.node.consul -p 5557 -r 5002\",\"status\":2,\"auto_restart\":true,\"uid\":1000,\"username\":\"vagrant\",\"gid\":1000}"
```

### 4. confirm the script executed successfully
```bash
$ tail /var/log/pmond/output.log
process restarted: 4 - "happac4"
```

## Flap Detection/Prevention

![Screenshot Backkoff](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec0d482f-9afe-438d-a5fd-18293a5c9ba2)


Flap Detection provides the ability to detect processes which are in a perpetually-failed state resulting in excessive restarts which can affect system performance among other things. To prevent excessive restarts you can enable flap detection in the configuration file. You can control the behavior by setting various [threshold parameters](#section_config) which ultimately affect how often a perpetually-failed process can restart within a given time interval.


### Enabling
```yaml
flap_detection_enabled: true
```

### Restart Threshold
Defaulted to `5`, is the amount of application restarts before the flap prevention process begins at which point the process will cease restarts and enter the backoff state.
```yaml
flap_detection_threshold_restarted: 5
```

### Countdown Threshold
Defaulted to `120`, is the amount of process monitor intervals until the flap prevention process (backoff state) ends and the application (if still in a perpectually failed state) will resume restarting as normal until the restart threshold is met again. The process monitor interval can also be set in the [configuration file](#section_config) which would affect the time in which it would take to countdown back to zero.
```yaml
flap_detection_threshold_countdown: 120
```

### Decrement Threshold
Defaulted to `60`, disabled with `0`, is the amount the amount of process monitor intervals during the flap prevention process (backoff state) until the application restart counter is decremented. This can affect how the countdown is reached effectively staggering application restarts during the countdown process. This is useful when you don't want to completely back off and allow for intermittent restarts during the flap prevention process (backoff state).
```yaml
flap_detection_threshold_decrement: 60
```

### Example 
Using the defaults provided above: since the process monitor interval defaults to `500` milliseconds, when a process enters the perpetually failed state and restarts the 5th time, it will enter the backoff state. At this point the flap prevention process will begin the countdown from `120` to `0`. Since the process monitor interval is `500` milliseconds, it will take `120` multiplied by `500` milliseconds which equals `60` seconds.

There is however one caveat: because the decrement threshold is `60`, the restart count will decrement from `5` to `4` after `60` multiplied by `500` milliseconds which equals `30` seconds. Instead, it will instead restart `30` seconds into the backoff state instead of `60` seconds. After the restart, the flap detection process will continue counting down to zero until exiting the flap detection process. If the application remains in a perpetually failed state, it will take `5` restarts to repeat this process all over again.

<a name="section_debugging"></a>
## Debugging

### Environment Variables

You can specify debug verbosity from both the `pmon3` client and the `pmond` daemon process using the `PMON3_DEBUG` environment variable.

```bash
PMON3_DEBUG=true pmond 
```

`PMON3_DEBUG` accepts the following values:
* `true`: sets the debug level to debug
* `debug`: has the same effect as true
* `info`: sets the debug level to info
* `warn`: sets the debug level to warn
* `error`: sets the debug level to error

You can also debug the underlying IPC library using `QOG_DEBUG=true`

```bash
XIPC_DEBUG=true PMON3_DEBUG=true pmon3 ls
```

### Configuration File

If you want more control over the verbosity you can set the loglevel in the yaml configuration file.

##### /etc/pmond/config/config.yml
```yaml
#possible values: debug/info/warn/error
#default value when empty or omitted
log_level: "info"
```

If you do not specify a value, `info` will be the default Logrus level.

<a name="section_performance"></a>
## Performance Prioritization

### CGO_ENABLED=0

By default, no underlying libraries require CGO. This allows for portability between machines using different versions of GLIBC and also provides easy installation using the [Release Installer](#release_installer) . Benchmarking results have confirmed less memory and CPU utilization compared to using the libraries which do require `CGO_ENABLED=1` provided below:

### Posix MQ

The `posix_mq` build tag can be provided to swap out the underlying [golang-ipc](https://github.com/joe-at-startupmedia/golang-ipc/) library with [posix_mq](https://github.com/joe-at-startupmedia/posix_mq). The `posix_mq` wrapper does require `CGO_ENABLED=1` and is considerably faster but also consumes slightly more CPU and Memory. To enable `posix_mq` during the build process:
```bash
BUILD_FLAGS="-tags posix_mq" make build_cgo
```

### CGO-based Sqlite

By default, `pmon3` utilizes an non-CGO version of sqlite which is unnoticably less performant in most circumstances. To enable the CGO version of sqlite:
```bash
BUILD_FLAGS="-tags cgo_sqlite" make build_cgo
```

It depends on your requirements whether you need one or both. To enable both of these CGO-dependent modules for maximizing overall performance:
```bash
BUILD_FLAGS="-tags posix_mq,cgo_sqlite" make build_cgo
```

Or without using the Makefile:
```bash
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -tags "posix_mq,cgo_sqlite" -o bin/pmon3 cmd/pmon3/pmon3.go
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -tags "posix_mq,cgo_sqlite" -o bin/pmond cmd/pmond/pmond.go
```

### Unix Sockets
Significantly less performant than the default shared memory implementation and posix_mq implementation. It also has the capability of utilizing TCP cockets with additional build flags (currently: `build -tags net,network`).

```bash
BUILD_FLAGS="-tags net" make build
```

Or without using the Makefile:
```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -tags net -o bin/pmon3 cmd/pmon3/pmon3.go
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -tags net -o bin/pmond cmd/pmond/pmond.go
```

<a name="section_problems"></a>
## Common Problems

### 1. Log Rotation?

`pmon3` comes with a logrotate configuration file, which by default utilizes the `/var/log/pmond` directory. If you require a custom log path, you can customize `config.yml` and `rpm/pmond.logrotate`

### 2. The process startup parameter must pass the absolute path?

If there is a path in the parameters you pass, please use the absolute path. The `pmon3` startup process will start a new sandbox environment to avoid environmental variable pollution.

### 3. Command line automation

`pmon3` provides Bash automation. If you find that the command cannot be automatically provided, please install `bash-completion` and exit the terminal to re-enter:

```bash
sudo yum install -y bash-completion
```

#### Using ZSH instead of Bash
```bash
autoload -U +X compinit && compinit
autoload -U +X bashcompinit && bashcompinit
sudo sh -c "pmon3 completion zsh > /etc/profile.d/pmon3.sh"
source /etc/profile.d/pmon3.sh
```

### 4. FATA/vagrant/go_src/pmon3/cmd/pmon3/pmon3.go:27 main.main() pmond must be running

If you encounter the error above, make sure the `pmond` service has started successfully.

```bash
sudo systemctl start pmond
```

### 5. Should I use `sudo` commands?

You should only use `sudo` to start the `pmond` process which requires superuser privileges due to the required process forking commands. However, the `pmon3` cli should be used *without* `sudo` to ensure that the spawned processes are attached to the correct parent pid. When using `sudo`, the processes will be attached to ppid 1 and as a result, will become orphaned if the `pmond` process exits prematurely. Using `sudo` also prevents non-root users from being able to access the log files. The following Makefile command applies the adequate non-root permissions to the log files.

#### Applying permissions
```bash
#This is automatically called by make systemd_install
make systemd_permissions
```

#### Spawn a new process as the root user without using `sudo`
```bash
pmon3 exec /usr/local/bin/happac --user root
```
